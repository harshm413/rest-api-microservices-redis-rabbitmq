## Architecture

The application follows a microservices architecture with the following key patterns:

- **API Gateway Pattern**: All client requests flow through a single gateway service that handles authentication, request validation, and routing to internal services.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Services communicate asynchronously through RabbitMQ for loose coupling and eventual consistency.
- **Database per Service**: Each service manages its own database, promoting independence and scalability.

**Request Flow**: Client requests hit the Gateway Service, which validates JWT tokens and forwards requests to the appropriate internal service (Auth, User, or Chat). Services communicate with each other through RabbitMQ events (e.g., user registration events are published by Auth Service and consumed by User Service to sync profile data).

## Services

### Gateway Service (Port 4000)

The public-facing entry point for all API requests. Responsibilities include:

- JWT token validation and user authentication
- Request routing to internal services
- Request/response transformation
- Rate limiting and security headers (Helmet)

### Auth Service (Port 4003)

Manages user authentication and authorization:

- User registration with password hashing (bcrypt)
- Login with credential validation
- JWT access token and refresh token generation
- Token refresh with rotation
- Token revocation
- Publishes user registration events to RabbitMQ

### User Service (Port 4001)

Manages user profile data:

- User profile retrieval
- User search functionality
- Consumes auth events to sync user data from registration

### Chat Service (Port 4002)

Handles real-time messaging features:

- Conversation creation and management
- Message sending and retrieval
- Redis caching for conversation data
- Message pagination with cursor-based navigation

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22 or higher
- pnpm 10 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rest-api-microservices-redis-rabbitmq.git
cd rest-api-microservices-redis-rabbitmq
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Update the environment variables as needed.

### 4. Start infrastructure services

```bash
docker compose up -d rabbitmq redis mongo user-db auth-db
```

### 5. Build the common package

```bash
pnpm --filter @rest-api/common build
```

### 6. Start all services (development)

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Or start individual services:

```bash
pnpm --filter gateway-service dev
pnpm --filter @rest-api/auth-service dev
pnpm --filter @rest-api/user-service dev
pnpm --filter chat-service dev
```

### Running with Docker Compose (Production)

To run the entire stack with Docker:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will start all services and their dependencies with health checks and automatic restarts.

## Project Structure

This is a monorepo managed with pnpm workspaces. The root contains `docker-compose.yml` for infrastructure, along with shared TypeScript and workspace configs.

**packages/common**: Shared library containing error classes, event types, HTTP middleware, validation utilities, and logging setup. All services depend on this package.

**services/gateway-service**: The API gateway. Contains controllers that proxy requests to internal services, JWT auth middleware, route definitions, and Zod validation schemas.

**services/auth-service**: Handles authentication. Contains Sequelize models for user credentials and refresh tokens, JWT token utilities, and a RabbitMQ publisher that emits events when users register.

**services/user-service**: Manages user profiles. Contains a RabbitMQ consumer that listens for auth events to sync user data, plus repositories and services for user CRUD operations.

**services/chat-service**: Handles messaging. Uses MongoDB for storing conversations and messages, Redis for caching, and follows a repository pattern for data access.
